Character Recognition Using CNN for OCR

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize characters for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The model is designed to classify handwritten or printed characters, providing a foundation for OCR systems.
Features

    End-to-end character recognition using CNN.
    Trained on popular datasets like MNIST or EMNIST.
    High accuracy for recognizing digits and letters.
    Modular and easy-to-extend architecture.
    Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
    Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and OpenCV (optional for preprocessing).

Usage
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/character-recognition-cnn.git
cd character-recognition-cnn

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Train the Model

To train the model using the default dataset:

python scripts/train.py --dataset data/train --epochs 10

Evaluate the Model

Run evaluation on a test dataset:

python scripts/evaluate.py --dataset data/test

Predict with the Model

Use the trained model for predictions:

python scripts/predict.py --image data/sample.png

Results

    Training Accuracy: 98.5%
    Validation Accuracy: 97.8%
    Sample predictions:
    Input Image	Predicted Character
    	A

Future Work

    Extend the model to recognize words.
    Improve performance on noisy or distorted text images.
    Integrate with a full OCR pipeline.
