# Character Recognition Using CNN for OCR

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize characters for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The model is designed to classify handwritten or printed characters, providing a foundation for OCR systems.\

# CNN Structure used :
   3 Convolution layer with 1 Dense Layer and Output dense layer to classify among the 35 Different Characters.\

# Prerequisites
   Python 3.8+\
   TensorFlow/Keras\ 
   Libraries: KaggleHub, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and OpenCV\

# Datasets used:
   For Training - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaibhao/handwritten-characters\
     Consists of individual chracters to train the CNN Model\
   For Testing - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/landlord/handwriting-recognition\
     Words to test the Trained CNN Model \

# Results :
   The model was run for 70 epochs provided the following results\
   Training Accuracy: 94.3%\
   Validation Accuracy: 91.4%\
